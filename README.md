Hello!

# How to set stuff up

Download and install GitHub Desktop:
https://desktop.github.com/

Open it up.
At the top toolbar, click on "File" -> "Clone Repository" -> "URL"
Then enter https://github.com/Pilex1/NMSSCodeProject for the URL, and choose an appropriate location for the local path (this is where all the files are going to be stored)
Click "Clone" and you're done!

Try changing something (e.g. editing a file, creating a new file, etc.)
You should now see your changes appear in the "Changes" tab.
To confirm those changes, you need to write down a brief summary of what changes you've made in the "Summary" textbox, then click on the "Commit to master" button.
