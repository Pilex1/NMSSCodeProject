# How to set stuff up

Download and install GitHub Desktop:
https://desktop.github.com/

At the top toolbar, click on "File" -> "Clone Repository" -> "URL"<br/>
Then enter https://github.com/Pilex1/NMSSCodeProject for the URL, and choose an appropriate location for the local path (this is where all the files are going to be stored)<br/>
Click "Clone" and you're done!<br/>
<br/>
Try changing something (e.g. editing a file, creating a new file, etc.)<br/>
You should now see your changes appear in the "Changes" tab.<br/>
To confirm those changes, you need to write down a brief summary of what changes you've made in the "Summary" textbox, then click on the "Commit to master" button.<br/>
