<h1>NMSS Code Project</h1>

Hello! This is a place for us to collaborate on programming projects.<br/>
Our main programming language is <b>Python 3</b><br/><br/>
For right now, we are going to start off with Project Euler. The plan is to have everyone working on the earlier problems individually and learning by sharing each other's work. For harder problems, we can have everyone working collaboratively.

<h2>How to set stuff up</h2>

Download and install GitHub Desktop:
https://desktop.github.com/

At the top toolbar, click on "File" -> "Clone Repository" -> "URL"<br/>
Then enter https://github.com/Pilex1/NMSSCodeProject for the URL, and choose an appropriate location for the local path (this is where all the files are going to be stored)<br/>
Click "Clone" and you're done!<br/>
<br/>
Try changing something (e.g. editing a file, creating a new file, etc.)<br/>
You should now see your changes appear in the "Changes" tab.<br/>
To confirm those changes, you need to write down a brief summary of what changes you've made in the "Summary" textbox, then click on the "Commit to master" button.<br/>
